    - Preparing 1.5.1 release
    - Implemented a callback for OpenBLAS as described in https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/28883
        - it’s bugged. I opened an issue in OpenBLAS repo https://github.com/OpenMathLib/OpenBLAS/issues/4770, which was quickly fixed but the fix doesn’t work 😟
    - threadpoolctl maintenance. Fixed flexiblas CI temporarily but needs investigation
    - build time numpy ≥ 2 requirement in pyproject.toml https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/29360

- Guillaume
    - OpenML hackathon
        - Modifying the way to find the URL of the ARFF file to be compatible with API v2 of OpenML through the `fetch_openml`. Useful for when we will switch to parquet files.
    - Minimal fixes on the POC RAG.
    - Giving some input to the product team regarding monkey-patching some scikit-learn thingy:
        - https://github.com/probabl-ai/hamstr/discussions/5
