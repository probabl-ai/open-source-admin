## 2024-02-06

### Gael (GaelVaroquaux)

- Discussions on skrub, dataframe API, and TableVectorizer with Jérome and Guillaume

### Olivier (ogrisel)

- OS team priority planning at probabl (ongoing, needs to be made public)
- Helped with an ICML submission (strongly related to hazardous)
    - Survival model working with Gradient boosted trees
- PRs and reviews:
    - iterating on calibration curve example:
        - [#28231](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/28231)
        - goal is to fix our wording on Logistic Regression calibration also in
          the user guide
            - [#28171](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/28171)
    - GPU FAQ update:
        - [#28328](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/28328)
    - rotated codecov token to fix the CI
        - [#28361](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/28361)
    - tried to investigate slow tests on scipy-dev pandas update PR:
        - [#28348](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/28348)
- Prototyping a fluent API to compose transformers for feature + target data
  engineering with iterative/interactive previews and builtin subsampling and
  train/test split / cross-validation handling.
    - Goal: experiment with a future vision for skrub (or maybe even
      scikit-learn in the longer term?)

### Guillaume (glemaitre)

- OS team priority
- Dev:
    - reviewing/merging PR for scikit-learn 1.4.1
        - regression in tree criterion:
          [#28327](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/28327)
    - discussion for design of `TableVectorizer` in skrub with Jerome
- Accepted talk to PyConDE:
    - need to go to the Algolia side
    - need some work to ragger-duck

### Arturo (ArturoAmorQ)

- a bit of mooc forum
- some reviews
- Gael's [mediation project](https://notes.inria.fr/Uz9HaPyJQ1yDY_LUuT2f-A#)
    - Goal: web UI to give intuitions on machine learning. Was asked a few
      months ago in the context of discussion with the broader society on the
      impact of ML on our lives
- planning to work on "advanced modules" for the mooc


### Loïc (lesteve)

- plenty of CI work (merged):
  - [Pytest 8](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/28318)
  - [pandas 2.2 warnings](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/28305)
  - [pandas copy-on-write fixes](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/28348)
- [code scanning workflow](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/28312) (merged)
- meson editable install limitations is
  getting [fixed](https://github.com/mesonbuild/meson-python/pull/569) following my
  issues ([`__path__` empty](https://github.com/mesonbuild/meson-python/issues/568),
  [`pytest --pyargs` not collecting tests](https://github.com/mesonbuild/meson-python/issues/557))
  and [Olivier PR attempt](https://github.com/mesonbuild/meson-python/pull/562)
- [codecov uploader update](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/28361)
  (merged)
- scipy-dev with Python 3.12 seems a lot slower (~50 minutes instead of ~25 minutes).
  Dataset downloads in part? Needs more investigation
  (seen in [#28348](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/28348))
- nogil build failing, needs Cython 3.0.8 for nogil Python:
  [#6](https://github.com/colesbury/nogil-wheels/pull/6)
- Try out Meson `make dev-meson` and report issues, if you haven't already :wink:.
  See [doc](https://scikit-learn.org/dev/developers/advanced_installation.html#building-with-meson)
  for more details.

### Jérôme (jeromedockes)

- skrub tablevectorizer; discussions with Guillaume & Gaël
  - storing state to have consistent transformations
  - applying transformations to part of a dataframe
  - support for pandas & polars
- skrub aggjoiner pr help & start reviewing
- reading & feedback on Riccardo's data lake fishing paper, some of which may
  end up in skrub
    - Context: one big messy data lake (many tables, we don't quite know what's
      in there), the challenge is table discovery: finding the tables that
      might lead to joins on a target table to help predict a given target

### Jérémie (jeremiedbb)
- administrative stuff
- extended flexiblas support for threadpoolctl

### TODO/next

- scikit-learn 1.4.1 (Guillaume)
    - calibration PR:
        - https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/28231
        - https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/28171
    - regression for decision tree:
      https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/28327
    - inappropriate casting for `SimpleImputer`:
      https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/28365
- Array API:
    - finalize `r2_score` PR:
        - https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/27904
    - Ridge, RidgeCV and maybe try Logistic Regression in //


### Topics/Questions to discuss at the end of the meeting

- META: how to organize this meeting:
    - sub-teams split when the OS team grows too large
    - move to a bi-weekly schedule for scikit-learn and other OS projects at
      probabl every other week.
    - stick to google meet
