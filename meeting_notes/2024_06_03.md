    - https://github.com/INRIA/scikit-learn-mooc/pull/780
    - Meeting MAPIE tomorrow
- Stefanie
    - PR nans in *weighted_*percentile:
      https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/29034
        - idea: setting weights for nan values to 0 and keep looking up the
          next lower value in the sorted columns of the data until we find a
          value that is not a nan
- Shruti
    - Running tests for sample weighting across regressors (paired t-tests,
      been checking whether sample size makes a difference)
    - Working with Olivier on other tests using `RandomForestClassifier` (is
      itâ€™s classification between weighted and repeated samples as good as
      random)
    - To work on different CV methods in classifier test (`KFold` vs
      `StratifiedShuffleSplit`)
- Olivier
    - Assisting Quansight draft the NASA ROSES v2 grant proposal
    - Follow-up on `TunedThresholdClassifierCV`
        - https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/29082 (improve UX
          by warning user about wrong usage patterns, highlighted API scorer,
          still WIP)
        - https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/29149 (improve the example)
        - Experiment with Elkanâ€™s optimal threshold both fixed for all
          individuals or adjusted per individual at prediction time:
            - https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/29150 (draft
              only at this point, turning this into a meta-estimator would
              require metadata routing via the predict method)
    - Reviewed GPU CI config
    - Submitted a tutorial for EuroScipy on Calibration and Cost-sensitive learning
- Adrin
    - Internal review process doc (in review by Guillaume and Olivier)
    - `transform_input` in `Pipeline` is in a good shape now:
      https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/28901
- JÃ©rÃ©mie
    - writeable param in check_array. Opened several related issues and PRs
      while making a common test: `copy` has no effect in some estimators
        - https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/29103,
          https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/29100,
          https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/29092,
          https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/29098
        - not sure how it should interact with array api
- LoÃ¯c
    - Investigating Python 3.13 free-threaded (aka nogil)
      https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/28978, no failures
      locally too good to be true? Numpy has a nightly wheel, waiting for Scipy
      to have a nightly wheel and we can then add a CI build. Submitted a talk
      to EuroScipy on this topic.
    - Meson fixes, most quirks have been fixed I think ðŸ¤ž. Let me know if you
      see others!
        - User-friendly errors when build dependencies are not satisfied. Two
          variations: https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/29132
          (pip-specific, simpler)
          https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/28721 (meson.build
          more generic but uglier)
    - Adopting spin https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/29012
        - Make `spin docs` work on Windows:
          https://github.com/scientific-python/spin/pull/206
        - meson editable verbose by default:
          https://github.com/scientific-python/spin/pull/192
    - PyPy support officially dropped
      https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/29128
- Tamara
    - PRs (fairlearn):
        - https://github.com/fairlearn/fairlearn/pull/1365# (replace flake8
          with ruff for linting)
        - https://github.com/fairlearn/fairlearn/pull/1363 (docs improvement,
          pandas doc build warnings, library import issue)
        - https://github.com/fairlearn/fairlearn/pull/1369 (merged,
          scikit-learn estimator tests fix)
        - https://github.com/fairlearn/fairlearn/pull/1362 (merged, docs improvement)
        - https://github.com/fairlearn/fairlearn/issues/1368
- Gael (if time permits)
    - Not scikit-learn, but related: been understanding better tradeoffs of
      imputation for prediction (currently writing a paper on this, should loop
      back on it with scikit-learn in a while but happy to chat about insights
      or share paper when submitted in a few weeks)
