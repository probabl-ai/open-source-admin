- Guillaume
    - Provide feedbacks on everyone pull requests in `scikit-learn`
    - Wrap-up objectives of Q2
    - (in progress) Writing blog post regarding RAG experiment
- Olivier
    - Catching up with github / slack notifications
    - Triaging duty this week
- Arturo
    - Looking for feedback on certification program by level
    - Got accepted to give a masterclass on [Class Likelihood Ratios](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/model_selection/plot_likelihood_ratios.html) for a bank
        - Planning to base it on the [EuroScipy 2022 tuto](https://github.com/ArturoAmorQ/euroscipy_2022_evaluation/tree/main)
    - Waiting for comments in https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/29499
    - Having problems with [binder](https://hub.ovh2.mybinder.org/user/inria-scikit-learn-mooc-j1d4w2i0/notebooks/notebooks/01_tabular_data_exploration.ipynb)
- Adrin
    - Some Array API work / reviews
    - Callbacks
    - skops persistence work
    - Made a prototype where people can upgrade their old models
    - sklearn “admin” work on linters and copyright notices
    - worked for 2/3 days with Camille in Berlin
    - need to review Vincent’s videos
    - Another issue was popped up related to early stopping / validation which requires my Pipeline transform metadata PR
    - “unwatch”ing the main repo for now when not on triage since it wasn’t being manageable for me
- Emily
    - Mostly community outreach related work last week
    - Talking to someone from RedHat right now. They working on multi-cluster orchestration on k8s (kubernetes), and the jobs that run on the clusters are AI jobs (eg. training)
        - “Those that use the cloud and those that use scikit-learn are two different groups of people”. Opinions?
    - Discussion on Array API weighted percentile
    - Still working on reproducing error in  https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/29486
- Stefanie
    - PR [ENH Array API for check_consistent_length](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/29519)
    - sync on Emilys PR [Add array API support for _weighted_percentile](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/29431#pullrequestreview-2201779144)
    - PR [MNT Update environment and lockfile for build doc with matplotlib unpinned](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/29548)
    - linear algebra course: matrix multiplication, inverse, elementary matrices, LU decomposition, interpolation
- Loïc
    - slowly understanding array API a bit more, e.g.: https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/29549
    - OpenMP on macOS with Meson 1.5 timeout in the CI: https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/29546#issuecomment-2245645209
    - add functionality to update lock-file through bot via PR comment by Charlie-XIAO https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/29505
    - free-threaded: running the scikit-learn test suite with threading as default joblib backend. I think there is some segmentation fault in Gaussian processes due to a race condition but I need to investigate more ...
    - meson/setuptools clean-up is continuing https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/29562 https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/29561. Still a few things I
    am aware of but low priority.
    - TODO prepare my talk for EuroSciPy on CPython 3.13 free-threaded
