- Olivier
    - Triaging duty (only a partial success)
    - Reviews for 1.5 milestoned PRs
        - `log_loss` `eps` and auto normalization deprecation
        - `multi_class` deprecation in `LogisticRegression`
        - partial review of the `TunedThresholdClassifier` PR
        - Live review of the `SplineTransformer` PR to add nan support (need to
          follow-up)
    - Array API reviews
        - Array API for `LabelEncoder`
    - Helped Quantsight draft a proposal for a new iteration of the NASA ROSES
      grant (Array API, multithreading/nogil, doc tools, supply chain
      security).
    - TODO:
        - `SplineTransformer`
        - Help Shruti getting started, maybe on `sample_weight` statistical
          testing, e.g. for `RANSACRegressor` first and then a common tests /
          audit of scikit-learn estimators?
- Jérémie
    - mostly reviews / PRs for 1.5
    - Currently releasing 1.5.0rc1
    - Started to work on making arrays writeable when needed
        - https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/28824)
        - hard to make a common test because estimators don’t actually copy
          when copy=False only for a specific config
    - Started to experiment on https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/28883
    - Triaging this week, but it will be a very short week :/
- Stefanie
    - continued on nan support for SplineTransformer

        - little issue conversing older scipy version
        - backwards building some refactoring around the creation of the bslines
        - attempted to avoid tolil() conversion, but seems too complicated to maintain
    - review 2017 RP on adding information gain as a feature selection function
      ([`https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/28905`](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/28905))
        - update to current standards
        - tweak test to accept different aggregate functions
- Adrin
    - Starting on developer API / third party friendly work
        - triaging some issues
        - starting with tags cleanup
    - Shruti in the office on Wednesday
