- Guillaume
    - Triage week
    - Created some project boards for scikit-learn
      [GitHub](https://github.com/orgs/scikit-learn/projects)
    - Catch up with notifications + pending reviews
        - Getting close to having the new website
            - https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/29037
            - https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/29038
    - Merged some previous PRs for the MOOC
    - Helping slightly for Antoine Baker technical interview
- Olivier
    - Giving feedback to Shruti on `RANSACRegressor` sample_weight fix and
      testing.
      https://github.com/probabl-ai/scikit-learn-exercise-snath-xoc/pull/3
    - Follow-up on nan handling in `SplineTransformer` /  weighed percentile
      and `np.nanpercentile` with weights in numpy 2.
        - `SplineTransformer`
          https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/28421
        - `_weighted_percentile` to review
          https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/29034
        - `np.nanpercentile`
          https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/26455
    - Array API reviews:
        - `LabelEncoder` https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/27381/
        - `StandardScaler`(WIP)
- Jérémie
    - Releasing 1.5.0 https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/29054
    - Add `writeable` param to check_array
      https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/29018
- Shruti
    - Working on pull request
      https://github.com/probabl-ai/scikit-learn-exercise-snath-xoc/pull/3 need to
      incorporate Olivier’s reviews
    - Looking at testing for diverse sample representation in the equivalence
      tests for sample weighting (i.e. weighting n times is similar to
      repeating the sample n times)
    - Started checking `SGDRegressor` as well for similarity in predictions and
      did some tests on deterministic models (`LinearRegression`, `SVR`, `Ridge`,
      `LinearSVR`)
    - Started also doing some tests on classifiers using different test
      datasets (iris, breast_cancer), ensemble classifiers also seem to have
      mismatch
    - Generally working days are Thursday and Friday. Next week will be working
      Monday and Tuesday.

    - Mooc stuff
    - Will try to address https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/25689
