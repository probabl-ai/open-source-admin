        - https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/29191: CPython 3.13 free-threaded now tested every morning or with  `[free-threaded]` in the commit message
    - Security report on GPU workflow
    - maintenance
        - https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/29235 review: avoid dead-lock at import by delaying ThreadpoolctlController creation
        - https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/29259 super quick review (typo fix in private function argument)
        - https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/29261 quick review: remove setuptools dependency from our tests, merged now ðŸ’š

- Stefanie
    - continued on **Add zero_division param to `cohen_kappa_score`**(https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/29210)
    - learning some linear algebra
    - started with adding `zero_division` to `class_likelihood_ratios`
- Olivier
    - Some triaging (including https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/29252 about ROC AUC that took me some time)
        - Probably need a Convex Hull version of ROC at some point (new feature)
        - Interesting recent paper on isotonic calibration (that is guaranteed to preserve the Convex Hull variant of ROC AUC) and can be generalized to multiclass calibration https://proceedings.mlr.press/v238/berta24a/berta24a.pdf
    - Reviews:
        - Free-threading PRs in scikit-learn and joblib
        - Nan handling in `_weighted_percentile`
        - Pair investigation with Shruti on crafting a minimal reproducer on `ElasticNetCV` which happens to be a duplicate of an old issue with a PR that was closed without being merged.
        - More array API reviews (including array API meeting with Jerome and Tim)
    - WIP review:
        - `force_writeable` in `check_array` needed for 1.5.1
- Shruti
    - Working on common tests for sample weighting and producing a report
    - ElasticNetCV, LassoCV, RandomForestRegressor, HistGradientBoostingRegressor and BaggingRegressor indicate problems
    - Working on issue https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/22914 for CV to add weight into alpha grid generation
- Tamara
    - currently working on making a PR for https://github.com/fairlearn/fairlearn/issues/1381
