- Tamara (Fairlearn)
    - Maintenance: going through old issues and PRs, pinging folks and opening older discussions. Attended a community call.
    - Merged all PRs that were waiting during the last meeting.
    - Implemented OpenML dataset caching like scikit-learn: https://github.com/fairlearn/fairlearn/pull/1392.
    - Working on fixing estimator checks in fairlearn. Merged: https://github.com/fairlearn/fairlearn/pull/1393 and https://github.com/fairlearn/fairlearn/pull/1394. Working on `check_classifiers_train` , which requires some design changes (part of the discussion in  https://github.com/fairlearn/fairlearn/issues/1395). This feeds into the effort of making fairlearn more scikit-learn compatible.
- Emily
    - A few Array API PRs got merged, but [this one](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/29300) broke the min-doc-dependency build. This issue is not reproducible on my local machine (Mac with Intel core i5). Itâ€™s also not reproducible on Omarâ€™s machine (Mac with M2 processor)
    - Talking to [SUSE Rancher](http://rancher.com) regarding potential collaboration
    - Going to attend [KubeCon + CloudNativeCon + Open Source Summit + AI_Dev China 2024](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/kubecon-cloudnativecon-open-source-summit-ai-dev-china/) in late August. Any particular groups and/or individuals I should prioritize speaking with? Any particular topics anyone is interested in or aligning with out goals?
