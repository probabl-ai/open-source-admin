- Hiring (point added by @Olivier Grisel):
    - 3 job openings in the Open Source team:
        - https://join.probabl.ai/jobs
        - Statistical ML profile has received the most applications.
        - Inspection / Fairness jobs.
        - Doc/UX.
    - We will start to conduct some early quick interviews with the most promising
      profiles.
- Development priorities
    - Need to discuss the priorities for `skrub`. I (Guillaume) will draft some and will
      get feedback.
        - Look at the roadmap from on the `skrub` website
        - We should have a sync tool (Discord?) for really limited discussion
          for `skrub` but main discussion should happen on GitHub.
    - Looked with Adrin at the GitHub boards for project management. It seems that the
      beta task-list feature could be really interested to have access.
- Going to give feedbacks for the all hands meeting:
    - start a notion doc to collaboratively draft bullet points?
        - I (Guillaume) will create a notion page such that we can have
          suggestion that we want to be relay in the all hands meeting.
- Need Review (maybe this should be discussed in the monthly meeting, as stated above):
    - Developer API metadata routing:
        - [#28467](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/28467)
    - nan in SplineTransformer:
        - [#28043](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/28043)
- [Adrin] Triage round-Robin within the scikit-learn project
    - we like the idea, we'll bring it up in the scikit-learn monthly meeting
- [Adrin] blog on hubspot (as a paper?)
- How to have more transparent documents for the Open Source team:
    - Public subsection of notion?
    - Manually managed exports (synced once every few months)?
    - Meeting notes manually managed by Guillaume
    - Need to cross-link those transparency documents (and also from the probabl.ai
      website).
- [Arturo] Submitted a bunch of maintenance PRs on the scikit-learn mooc
  (feedback appreciated)
    - [#763](https://github.com/INRIA/scikit-learn-mooc/pull/763),
    - [#764](https://github.com/INRIA/scikit-learn-mooc/pull/764),
    - [#765](https://github.com/INRIA/scikit-learn-mooc/pull/765).
